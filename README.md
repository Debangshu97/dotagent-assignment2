# Mentally-The mental health app

## Overview

Do you have thoughts which you feel you cannot share with anyone? Dont be sad open up! We got your back. With Mentally you can chat with our AI chatbot and share whatever is in mind. Your thoughts will be totally private so dont worry about anything.

## Tech Stack

The following technologies:

- React
- Vite
- Sass
- Rapid Api
- Axios
- Netlify

## Objectives

The idea is described in the following points:

- This is a webapp with 2 pages. The Home page opens up on visiting the website and the Chatbot is in the Chat page.
- I access the chatbot from the Rapid Api api.The api call is made through Axios post request because it converts the response directly to json.
- Implement best practices and standards when structuring the files using nested elements, indentation, comments, and line breaks
- Implemented CSS styling via class, id and element selectors using external stylesheets, inline styles and embedded style tags.I used Sass instead of vanilla CSS to better format the css file.
- Used Vite instead of Create-React-App as Vite is provides better features likes faster hot reload and less project setup time.
- I used netlify to deploy and host the app as it is very convenient and free.
